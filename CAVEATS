Building DBD::DB2
-----------------
1.  The DBD::DB2 driver is supported by DB2 UDB V5.2.
    For existing DB2 UDB V5.0 customers, FixPak 6
    is required.  The actual FixPak 6 numbers for the
    supported operating system platforms are as follows:
    	AIX - U459852
	HP V10 - U459854
	HP V11 - not available as of September 24, 1998
	Solaris - U459853
    See http://www.software.ibm.com/data/db2/perl for
    more information on supported environments.
2.  The DB2 UDB Developer's Edition is required.
3.  DB2 UDB must be installed in /usr/lpp/db2_05_00 or
    the DB2_HOME environment variable must point to the
    installed location.

Special Notes re: HP-UX
-----------------------
1.  At the present time, HP-UX V11 cannot dynamically load
    libraries that contain thread local storage.  As such,
    additional libraries, -lpthread and -lcl, MUST be
    specified when building perl.  If this is not done,
    errors will occur during the DBD::DB2 "make test" phase.
2.  In order to avoid some warnings when building perl,
    DBI, and DBD::DB2, you may want to add the compile
    option, +DAportable.  This compile option is used
    to generate code that is compatible across both
    PA_RISC 1.1 and 2.0 workstations and servers.

Using DBD::DB2
--------------
1.  In order to execute a statement with parameter markers
    against a host DBMS (i.e. DB2 for OS/390), you must call
    bind_param() to bind values to the parameter markers.
2.  If you are using $sth->bind_param(index, value, type_hash_ref) 
    to bind values to parameter markers, then it must be called
    immediately prior to calling execute().  Note that a minimal
    set of type_hash_refs are provided by DB2.pm and they may
    be used to create new type_hash_refs
        $new_type = { %$existing_type, 'Stype' => SQL_"NewTYPE" };
3.  Note that as of DB2 UDB CLI V5.0, deferred prepare is on by
    default (DBD::DB2 is a CLI application).  To change this 
    behaviour, the value of the DEFERREDPREPARE keyword in
    db2cli.ini must be changed.  Support is not yet available  
    available to change this value at the statement level
    (via a statement attribute).

Unsupported Features (wrt DBI 0.93)
-----------------------------------
1.  The following attributes are not yet supported:
        ChopBlanks, LongReadLen, LongTruncOk
2.  Fetching any type of LOB directly to a file.
3.  Writing/inserting of LOBs.
