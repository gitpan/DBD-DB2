Added access to the SetStmtOption call, which in conjunction with
DB2 v 2.1.1 NLV2 will allow asynchronous database access among other
things.  SEE the DB2 CLI manual for details.

NOTE:  I don't have any sufficiently large database to tell if
asynchronous access is working properly.  Other options appear to
be working.....so I'm assuming that asynchronous access is.


Caveats:
    DBD::DB2 assumes the following:
        1.  That the DBD::DB2 is built against
            DB2 v2.1.0 or higher (AIX/UNIX, OS/2 versions)

        2.  DB2 is installed in /usr/lpp/db2_02_01
            or DB2_HOME points to the installed location

        3.  That the following have been exported in the current
            environment:

            export DBI_DRIVER=DB2
            export DBI_NAME="instance"  where "instance" is the DB2
                                        instance name

    Immediately prior to calling $sth->execute() you must call
    $sth->bind_param(index, name, type_hash_ref).   Note, that a
    minimal set of type_hash_refs are provided by DB2.pm and they
    may be used to create new type_hash_refs
        $new_type = { %$existing_type, 'Stype' => SQL_"NewTYPE" };

    Fetching of CLOB and DLOBS is not currently supported.

    Fetching any type of blob directly to a file is not implemented.
   
    Writing of blobs is currently unsupported ( It doesn't work...yet).

    All requested columns are returned.  So if you don't want the
    column, don't ask for it.
