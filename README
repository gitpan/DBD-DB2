Unzip DBD-DB2-0.70.OS390.tar.gz and get DBD-DB2-0.70.OS390.tar.
Use the following command to unpax the file:
   pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r < DBD-DB2-0.70.OS390.tar
After the unpax, you will get the directory named "DBD-DB2-0.70.OS390"
From this directory, you should read the README and CAVEATS file first.
You should delete Perl and DBI that were previously installed and
reinstall PERL, DBI and DBD::DB2 using the instruction in the CAVEATS file.
For better control of the build process, you should build perl into
the private directory and use this perl to install DBI and DBD::DB2 driver
You should use "GNU make" instead of the system make during installation.
