	1. This version fixes a problem with setting/unsetting
       AutoCommit on the database handle...I need a better
       test suite :-(

	2. Fixed problem with connect/disconnect/connect cycle

Oct 7, 1996

Added access to the SetStmtOption call, which in conjunction with
DB2 v 2.1.1 NLV2 will allow asynchronous database access among other
things.  SEE the DB2 CLI manual for details.

NOTE:  I don't have any sufficiently large database to tell if
asynchronous access is working properly.  Other options appear to
be working.....so I'm assuming that asynchronous access is.

Fixed the following:

    1. Prototype warnings from xsub.

    2. Invalidated cursor messages when exiting after finishing the
       cursors.

June 21, 1996

Fixed the following:

    1. Fixed a package naming problem with the Constants package.

	   Screwed up the package name change which caused the tests
       to fail on a clean build system.  Unfortunately, on my test
       systems I was picking up an old copy.... 

NOTE:  **********************************************************

      Any reference to               DB2::Constants, 
      MUST now be               DBD::DB2::Constants

*****************************************************************

Fixed the following:

    1.  Not returning the SQLCODE associated with the error.

        All error information is now available from perl - you
        can get SQLCODE from err, sql message string from errstr,
        and SQLSTATE from state.

    2.  Returning a perl failure on connect when a sql failure was
        needed.

        Perl will now see a !defined($var) on connection failure, so
        that scripts my fail gracefully.

    No KNOWN problems -- it is however alpha software.

	NOTE: ***********************************************************
          This will be the last release of DB2perl this year.  I will
          be migrating the functionality to the new foundation just
          announced by Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk.  Only major bug fixes will
          be done.
    NOTE: ***********************************************************

    Fetching of BLOBs (not CLOBs, or DLOBs) is working.

    Fixed some problems with inserting explicit NULLs into tables and
      retrieving rows containing explict NULLs reported by
      chet@watson.ibm.com


Sept. 22, 1995
    Fetching data works by either
       @row = $sth->fetchrow()  or ($f1, $f2, $f2) = $sth->fetchrow()

Sept. 19, 1995
	Initial beta release

CAVEATS:
*************************************************************************
    DBD::DB2 assumes the following:
        1.  That the DBD::DB2 is built against
            DB2 v2.1.0 or higher (AIX/UNIX, OS/2 versions)

        2.  DB2 is installed in /usr/lpp/db2_02_01
            or DB2_HOME points to the installed location

        3.  That the following have been exported in the current
            environment:

            export DBI_DRIVER=DB2
            export DBI_NAME="instance"  where "instance" is the DB2
                                        instance name

    Immediately prior to calling $sth->execute() you must call
    $sth->bind_param(index, name, type_hash_ref).   Note, that a
    minimal set of type_hash_refs are provided by DB2.pm and they
    may be used to create new type_hash_refs
        $new_type = { %$existing_type, 'Stype' => SQL_"NewTYPE" };

    Fetching of CLOB and DLOBS is not currently supported.

    Fetching any type of blob directly to a file is not implemented.
   
    Writing of blobs is currently unsupported ( It doesn't work...yet).

    All requested columns are returned.  So if you don't want the
    column, don't ask for it.
