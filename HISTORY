  Remove cached statement attributes for multiple result sets

  Add support for AS/400

  names returned are now qualified with the schema.

March 29, 2001

DBD::DB2 0.75

  Add new statement attributes.

  Removed db2_async_enable and db2_auto_ipd connection attributes as
  they have no relevance to a DBI program.

  Fix a problem when fetched data is truncated due to LongReadLen.

  Add support for spaces in DB2 install path name on Windows NT.

  Fixed build problem with ActivePerl on Windows NT when ActivePerl
  was installed without a compiler environment (i.e. libpth in
  Config.pm does not include the compiler library paths).

  DB2_HOME is no longer required if the build is performed in a
  properly configured DB2 environment (i.e. the DB2 'bin' directory
  is in the PATH environment variable).

  Rename DB2 specific attributes to comply with DBI naming
  convention (i.e. use lower case and prefix with db2_).  Old
  attributes still accepted for the time being.

  Add new connection attributes.

  Miscellaneous performance enhancements.


May 12, 2000

April 14, 2000

DBD::DB2-0.72

  Added support for bind_param_inout.

  Added support for binary (including BLOB) columns.  Added new
  attribute type $attrib_binary for inserting raw data.

  Added support for LOB input from file (bind attribute 'File=1').
  Added new attribute types $attrib_blobfile, $attrib_clobfile and
  $attrib_dbclobfile.

  Added support for LongReadLen, LongTruncOk and ChopBlanks
  attributes.

  Fixed retrieval of binary columns so data is returned unconverted.
  (i.e. binary data x'abcd' is not converted to 4 byte string "abcd"
  but rather results in 2 bytes of data 0xabcd).

  General performance improvements.


January 12, 1999

DBD::DB2-0.71

  Ported to Windows NT!

  It is now mandatory for the user to set the DB2_HOME environment
  variable to the installed location of DB2 UDB.  It will no longer
  default to /usr/lpp/db2_05_00.  This was done to accommodate ports
  to other platforms which have different default installation paths.

  Calls to deprecated CLI functions replaced by newer ones
  (i.e. SQLAllocStmt() replaced by SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT,...).

  A couple of bugs in dbd_bind_ph() were fixed.


September 25, 1998

DBD::DB2-0.70

   Corrected values returned from execute().
   Added support for CursorName, TYPE, PRECISION,
      and SCALE statement attributes.
   Minor cleanup.


July 5, 1998

DBD::DB2-0.68

   Found and fixed a couple of bugs relating to the handling of
      remote data


May 11, 1998

DBD::DB2-0.67

    Fixed a bug dealing with functions returning SUCCESS_WITH_INFO


April 2, 1998

DBD::DB2-0.66
    Rewrote code to support multiple concurrent connections

    Fixed a pair of bugs, dealing with nested error codes not
    being properly returned.

    Tested against DB2 version 5

****
    Added untested routines to SetConnectionOptions and to
    SetStmtOptions ****  Experimental needs to be moved to
    private_*
****


Dec 10, 1997

    Fixed a pair of errors which resulted in the infamous
      "DBI Handle has uncleared implementors data" on finishing
      statements prior to disconnect.


Feb 7, 1997

        Created a small pod for DBD::DB2.  Hopefully, this
        will lighten the email load.

        Rolled in all the changes needed to make it compile cleanly
        on Solaris

        Output Parameters for stored procedures now work.

Dec 12, 1996
        1. This version fixes a problem with setting/unsetting
       AutoCommit on the database handle...I need a better
       test suite :-(

        2. Fixed problem with connect/disconnect/connect cycle

Oct 7, 1996

Added access to the SetStmtOption call, which in conjunction with
DB2 v 2.1.1 NLV2 will allow asynchronous database access among other
things.  SEE the DB2 CLI manual for details.

NOTE:  I don't have any sufficiently large database to tell if
asynchronous access is working properly.  Other options appear to
be working.....so I'm assuming that asynchronous access is.


Aug 16, 1996

Fixed the following:

    1. Prototype warnings from xsub.

    2. Invalidated cursor messages when exiting after finishing the
       cursors.

June 21, 1996

Fixed the following:

    1. Fixed a package naming problem with the Constants package.

           Screwed up the package name change which caused the tests
       to fail on a clean build system.  Unfortunately, on my test
       systems I was picking up an old copy....

NOTE:  **********************************************************

      Any reference to               DB2::Constants,
      MUST now be               DBD::DB2::Constants

*****************************************************************

June 12, 1996

Fixed the following:

    1.  Not returning the SQLCODE associated with the error.

        All error information is now available from perl - you
        can get SQLCODE from err, sql message string from errstr,
        and SQLSTATE from state.

    2.  Returning a perl failure on connect when a sql failure was
        needed.

        Perl will now see a !defined($var) on connection failure, so
        that scripts my fail gracefully.


April 25, 1996
    No KNOWN problems -- it is however alpha software.


Nov. 17, 1995

        NOTE: ***********************************************************
          This will be the last release of DB2perl this year.  I will
          be migrating the functionality to the new foundation just
          announced by Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk.  Only major bug fixes will
          be done.
    NOTE: ***********************************************************

    Fetching of BLOBs (not CLOBs, or DLOBs) is working.

    Fixed some problems with inserting explicit NULLs into tables and
      retrieving rows containing explict NULLs reported by
      chet@watson.ibm.com


Sept. 22, 1995
    Fetching data works by either
       @row = $sth->fetchrow()  or ($f1, $f2, $f2) = $sth->fetchrow()

Sept. 19, 1995
        Initial beta release
